Summary Collection for Data Visualization

One page Summary:

After read that Video from Stanford's website named Journalism in the Age of Data, I know some current situation for journalism and how important data visulization imply on this field.

In recent years, journalists cooperate with computer scientsts, researchers and artists for data visulization. They use data visualization techniques let the data easy to know and make as news.Some journalists company start retools the staff to prepare the data medium in the future. Because the explosion of data brought a complementary need for tools to analyze it, so how to communicate with data and data visulization already become a problem.

But a lot of expert of data visualization are helping by bilding tools for these journalists.And also journalists are finding ways to explain visualization data instead of tradition data. But how to explain these visualization effectively also is a problem. Nowadays, data is become very important in our life, and will exist in everywhere. So its challenging our ability to adsorb, analyze and display. However, the good news is the technology for data visualization are in transition, its will help us to connect data and visualization together easily.
